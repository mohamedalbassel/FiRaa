# FiRaa
A machine learning model and application (FiRaa) is created as a Revit add-in with C# language, python and Revit API (Application Programming Interface) based on text mining algorithm which applies fire codes on BIM models. It can be adjusted by adding more fire codes to be applied and more datasets can be added for better classifications. The source code is available on (https://github.com/mohamedalbassel/FiRaa ).
